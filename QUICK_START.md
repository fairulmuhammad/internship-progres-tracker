- Ensure file is valid JSON for imports

### Performance Issues?
- Export old data if you have hundreds of entries
- Clear browser cache
- Close other browser tabs

## ðŸ“Š Understanding Your Statistics

- **This Week**: Hours logged this week (Sunday-Saturday)
- **Avg per Day**: Total hours divided by days with entries

## ðŸ’¾ Data Safety

Your data is stored in your browser's local storage and persists between sessions. However:
- **Export regularly** as backup (weekly recommended)
- Data is **device/browser specific**
- **Clear browser data** will delete your memos
- Use **import/export** to transfer between devices
