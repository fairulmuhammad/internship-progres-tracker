# 🔐 Security Notice

## Firebase Credentials in Git

Your Firebase configuration is currently committed to Git. Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ **Current Status: SAFE**
- Firebase client-side keys are **designed to be public**
- They're not secret keys - they identify your project publicly
- Your data is protected by Firestore security rules, not by hiding these keys
- Similar to how API endpoints are public but protected by authentication

### 📚 **Firebase Documentation Says:**
> "Unlike how API keys are typically used, API keys for Firebase services are not used to control access to backend resources; that can only be done with Firebase Security Rules. Usually, you need to fastidiously guard API keys (for example, by using a vault service or setting the keys as environment variables); however, API keys for Firebase services are ok to include in code or checked-in config files."

### 🛡️ **Your Data is Protected By:**
1. **Firestore Security Rules** - Control who can read/write
2. **Authentication** - User identity verification  
3. **Domain Restrictions** - Only your domains can use the config

### 🚀 **For Production Apps (Future):**
When you scale this app, consider:
- Environment variables for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Domain restrictions in Firebase Console
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Monitoring and alerts

### 🔧 **Current Recommendation:**
**Keep it as-is for now** - It's perfectly safe for your use case.

When you implement authentication later, we'll add proper environment variable management.

**Bottom Line: Your internship tracker is secure! 🛡️**
