# üö® SECURITY ALERT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Firebase API Key Compromised

Your Firebase API key has been detected as publicly exposed on GitHub. **This is a critical security issue.**

### **URGENT STEPS TO TAKE RIGHT NOW:**

#### 1. **Revoke the Compromised Key** (Do this FIRST)
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
- Find the API key: `AIzaSyBXyDjhD-uewbVQyfBIGF08sVJ6DTypJPU`
- **DELETE or RESTRICT** this key immediately

#### 2. **Generate New API Key**
- In Firebase Console: Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your apps
- Generate a new API key for your web app
- Copy the complete configuration

#### 3. **Update Configuration**
- Edit `js/config.js` 
- Replace `YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE` with your new API key
- Replace other placeholder values as needed

#### 4. **Security Review**
Check your Firebase project for:
- Unusual activity in Authentication logs
- Unexpected database reads/writes
- New users you didn't create
- Modified security rules

#### 5. **Prevent Future Exposure**
- `js/config.js` is now in `.gitignore`
- Never commit actual API keys to git again
- Use the template file for sharing code

### **Files That Contained the Exposed Key:**
- ‚ùå `js/config.js` - FIXED
- ‚ùå `analytics.html` - NEEDS FIXING
- ‚ùå `auth-test.html` - NEEDS FIXING  
- ‚ùå `tasks.html` - NEEDS FIXING
- ‚ùå `tasks_backup_current.html` - NEEDS FIXING

### **After Fixing:**
1. Test that your app still works with the new key
2. Commit the template files (without real keys)
3. Close the GitHub security alert as "Revoked"

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT IGNORE THIS** - Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and unexpected charges.
