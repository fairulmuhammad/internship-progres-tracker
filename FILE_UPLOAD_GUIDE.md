## üîß **Technical Details**

### **File Storage**
- Files are stored as **base64** encoded data in your browser's local storage
- **Images** are stored efficiently for quick viewing
- **All file types** retain their original format and metadata

### **File Processing**
- Files are processed **client-side** for privacy and speed
- **Large files** (>10MB) are rejected to prevent performance issues
- **Multiple files** are processed concurrently for efficiency

### **Data Export/Import**
- **Export**: All attachments are included in your backup JSON file
- **Import**: Restore your data with all files intact
- **Cross-device**: Transfer your complete data including files between devices

## üì± **Mobile & Accessibility**

- **High contrast**: File icons and buttons are clearly visible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Privacy & Security**
- Files are stored **locally** in your browser
- **No cloud upload** - your files never leave your device
- **Private by default** - only you can access your files

### **Browser Storage Limits**
- Most browsers allow **5-10MB** total local storage
- **Large files** or many attachments may approach limits
- **Export regularly** to prevent data loss
- **Consider file optimization** for large images

### **File Compatibility**

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **File Organization**
1. **Descriptive names**: Use clear, descriptive file names
2. **Relevant files only**: Only attach files directly related to the memo
3. **Optimize images**: Compress large screenshots before uploading
4. **Multiple formats**: Include both source files and final outputs

### **File Management**
1. **Regular cleanup**: Remove unnecessary files during editing
2. **Backup strategy**: Export your data including files regularly
3. **File versioning**: Include version numbers in file names if needed
4. **Documentation**: Mention important files in your memo description

### **Performance Tips**
1. **Optimize images**: Use tools to compress large screenshots
2. **Text over images**: Prefer text descriptions over image-heavy documentation
3. **Archive old files**: Export and clear old attachments periodically
4. **File selection**: Be selective about which files truly add value
